    Since 2019 I have been working with sequencing data, primarily single-cell RNA sequencing,
    and more recently, spatial transcriptomics. Here are the two vignettes to help intuitively
    understand some aspects of the data for specific problems of:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://mxposed.github.io/notebooks/sc-balancing/">optimization for more equal sequencing output</a> when sequencing multiple
    libraries at once;</li>
    <li><a href="https://mxposed.github.io/notebooks/interactive_cell_visualization.html">comparing cell type contributions to spatial niches</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    For our <a href="https://www.jci.org/articles/view/170682">Machine learning links unresolving secondary pneumonia to mortality in patients with severe pneumonia, including COVID-19</a>
    publication, I have created an interactive visualization of the electronic health record data from
    our intensive care unit: <a href="https://nupulmonary.org/carpediem/browser/"><i>CarpeDiem</i> data browser</a>.
    The primary goal of this tool was to allow a global overview of all the data (each day of each patient),
    with the ability to zoom in on specific measurement, to enable discovery and spot-checking of patterns.
    This is an open-source tool built with d3.js, source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/NUSCRIPT/CarpeDiem/tree/main/data_browser">github</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, I have helped with several interactive visualization projects:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/37/23/4578/6318386">UCSC Cell Browser</a>, a browser for single-cell data;</li>
    <li><a href="https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.07698">funkyheatmap</a>, a package for flexible visualization of dataframes.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    I will be adding more links to this page as I  finish more projects, so you might want to
    check back in a couple of months.
</p>
<p>
    I want to also highlight my inspiration, Bret Victor's work, particularly
    <a href="https://worrydream.com/MediaForThinkingTheUnthinkable/">this project</a>, but if you
    don't know him, please check out his other projects too.
